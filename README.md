# Exits

A collection of python scripts to help model incentives for LLC and C-corp companies.

- Input person
    - how much they own and vesting schedule
        - LLC: Founding stock, PI
        - C Corp: # Shares, Options
    - Costs
        - what is the best effort guess of the value of the person's time
        - how much time that person puts in (on average)
- Independent Variables
    - Time
    - Exit Value
- Dependent Variables
    - Each person's exit amount

## Roadmap

- [x] LLC person input, founders stock and PI calculation
- [x] Calculate exit value per person at various exit values
